### Time Deltas

```

{{date-and-time publishedAt}} {{! January 1, 2014 12:00 AM}}
{{date-and-time publishedAt 'pt-br'}} {{! 1 de janeiro de 2014 às 00:00}}
```


### Custom Format

```hbs
{{time-format updatedAt 'l'}} {{! => 10/9/2014}}
```

### Day of the Week

```hbs
{{day-of-the-week someDate}} {{! => Friday}}
```

## Locale Support

In order to add locale support, you need to import the locale file in your app's `Brocfile.js`:

```js
app.import(app.bowerDirectory + '/moment/locale/pt-br.js');
```

You then have the ability to specify any imported locale with:

```hbs
{{time-format createdAt 'LLLL' 'pt-br'}}
{{time-ahead-in-words nextHour 'pt-br'}}
```
